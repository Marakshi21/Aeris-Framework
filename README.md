# Aeris-Framework
The Aeris Framework acts as a central framework for all mods developed by its primary author, Dusk21. It has no central focus beyond enabling the sharing of C# across mods and acting as a central place to inspect, comment on, fix, and optimize all C# created and used. Currently, the framework is very barebones as my knowledge in C# is limited.
